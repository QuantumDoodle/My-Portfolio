                <p>I pursued my passion for technology by embarking on a journey in the field of software development. With a solid educational foundation and a commitment to continuous learning, I completed my Bachelor of Science from Career College, Bhopal with a focus on Information Technology. I consistently maintained a high level of academic performance, demonstrating my dedication and aptitude for the field. My professional interests align closely with the dynamic and ever-evolving world of software development. Some of the areas that particularly intrigue me include: Web Development: Creating interactive and user-friendly web applications using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Application Development: Designing and building software applications that cater to specific user needs, often utilizing languages like Python, Java, or C++. I'm particularly interested in joining a dynamic team that values collaboration and encourages continuous learning.</p>

                <p>This project is a basic calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a simple interface with buttons for numbers and arithmetic operators, along with a display area to show the input and results. JavaScript functions handle appending input to the display, clearing the display, and performing calculations. The calculator dynamically updates the display as users input values and evaluates expressions when the equals button is clicked. Error handling is included to manage invalid expressions. Overall, it's a user-friendly and functional calculator application designed for web browsers.</p>
